RESTful Book Store API
This project is a RESTful API for managing a book store, built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage books within the store's inventory.

Features:
Create: Add new books to the inventory with details such as title, author, pages, genres, rating, and reviews.
Read: Retrieve information about individual books or the entire inventory.
Update: Modify existing book details including title, author, pages, genres, rating, and reviews.
Delete: Remove books from the inventory based on unique identifiers.
Search: Search for books based on various criteria such as title, author, genre, or rating.
Validation: Validate incoming requests to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to provide informative responses for invalid requests or server errors.
RESTful Design: Follow RESTful principles for clear and intuitive API endpoints.
Technologies Used:
Node.js: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of APIs and web servers.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing book information in a flexible and scalable manner.
Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a straightforward way to work with MongoDB objects.
Usage:
Install dependencies: npm install
Start the server: npm start
Access the API endpoints using a REST client or integrate them into your application.
